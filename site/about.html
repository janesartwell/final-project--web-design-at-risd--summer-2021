    This semester, I played with lighting, scene, and color to make a series of photos that hopefully feel like a fragmented yet familiar narrative, or at least sequence. They hang together as a series of flashbacks, as buried memories that have come up to the surface for air.  While there is no subject matter or theme I was limited to, upon looking back, I see a series of remembrances: fond, strained, or imagined entirely. I read somewhere that photography is like taxidermy. It stuffs moments with importance, with a feeling of death or at least a sense of the past. Perhaps because they are photographed, these moments become important. Memories, for me, are so tied to the visual realm: the sign for a certain rest stop on the highway, an old bookcase, a poster in a bedroom, or the color of an old coat. There is, usually, a duality present in the process of remembrance, in the process of mourning, or in the process of preserving: the duality of ease and tension. I hope that these photos portray both the ease and the tension that was ever present for me while shooting â€” the ease and tension between the object and the landscape, the real and the unreal, and between me (the photographer) and my subject. The landscapes portray a certain languid serenity, while I hope that other photos, like the portraits, strain against this feeling.</p>
